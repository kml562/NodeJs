# I/O


In Node.js, I/O stands for Input/Output. It refers to the process of reading data from external sources (input) or writing data to external destinations (output). Node.js is designed to handle I/O operations efficiently, and its asynchronous, non-blocking I/O model is one of its key features.

Here's a brief explanation of I/O in Node.js:

### 1. Input (Read Operations):
   Input operations involve reading data from external sources, such as files, databases, or network requests. In Node.js, these operations are typically handled using asynchronous functions that do not block the program's execution while waiting for the data to be read. When an input operation is initiated, Node.js continues to execute other tasks, and once the data is available, a callback function is invoked to process the retrieved data.

   For example, when reading data from a file in Node.js, you would use functions like `fs.readFile()` or `fs.createReadStream()`. Similarly, for making network requests, you would use modules like `http` or `https`.

### 2. Output (Write Operations):
   Output operations involve writing data to external destinations, such as saving data to a file or sending data over a network. Like input operations, output operations in Node.js are also handled using asynchronous functions to prevent blocking the program's flow during the write process.

   For example, when writing data to a file in Node.js, you would use functions like `fs.writeFile()` or `fs.createWriteStream()`. When sending data over the network, you would use modules like `http` or `https` to create and send HTTP requests.

By utilizing an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, Node.js can efficiently handle multiple concurrent I/O operations without wasting resources, making it particularly well-suited for applications that require real-time data processing, high concurrency, and responsiveness. This I/O model allows Node.js to handle many connections simultaneously and ensures that the application remains performant even under heavy loads.
